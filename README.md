# Scala Tutorial #

This project originated from the Scala tutorial during the July 11th SF-Scala meetup (http://www.meetup.com/SF-Scala/events/189967052/).

The code here is my implementation/solution to the exercises. Please feel free to ping me if you have any questions.

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd Scala_Tutorial
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
